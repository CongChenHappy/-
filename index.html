            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;</p> 
            <p>I'm Cong Chen, a Ph.D. candidate supervised by <a href="https://people.ece.cornell.edu/ltong/">Prof.Lang Tong</a> in the Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) 
                at Cornell University. My research interests lie in the intersection of power system engineering, optimization theory, power system economics, and electricity markets. 
                My current research focuses on decarbonization solutions through large-scale aggregation of distributed energy resources, battery storage participation in wholesale and 
                retail electricity markets, and alternative energy resources such as green hydrogen. I was the recipient of the Best Paper Award at the IEEE Power & Energy Society (PES) 
                General Meeting in 2019, and the Prize Conference Paper Award at the IEEE PES General Meeting in 2023. My hobbies are hiking, photography, playing the piano, rock climbing, and snowboarding. </p>
